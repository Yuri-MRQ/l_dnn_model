# l_dnn_model
A l layer DNN model create from scratch.
I create this mo todel put in pratice what was learned on the Andrew Ng Deep learning specialization course, I made some modifications so that I could use to binary classification and multiclassification task.
This implementation show me the importance of a correct weigth implementation to successfully build a DL model.

Thanks to Andrew Ng Deep learning specialization course, Aurélien Géron Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow book and https://charleslow.github.io/softmax_from_scratch/.
